            <h2>Lyrics of Last Words of A Shooting Star</h2>
            <pre>
                All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
                Apologies from the intercom
                And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
                They'll think of me kindly
                When they come for my things
                They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
                With no thoughts like a blood-sniffing shark
                And while my dreams made music in the night
                Carefully I was going to live
                You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
                You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
                And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
                But I know through mine you were looking in yours
                And did you know the liberty bell is a replica
                Silently housed in its original walls?
                And while its dreams played music in the night
                Quietly, it was told to believe
                I always wanted to die clean and pretty
                But I'd be too busy on working days
                So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
                I couldn't have changed anyways
                I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
                Goodbye
